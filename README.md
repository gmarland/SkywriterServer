SkywriterServer
===============

## Overview

These are the server services for Skywriter. They should sit on a URL that can be accessed from wherever you have installed a Skywriter client app.

Installing the Skywriter client app on 2 computers and logging in using the same account allows messages to be instantly shared. Imagine an instant messenger but the people you are talking to are your own computers.


## Installation

Once installed, you can change the location where the SQLite database will be stored on the server. The SQLite database contains all the users who have their Skywriter client connected

## Requirements

Skywriter uses SignalR to ass around messages and therefore requires .NET 4.5 to be installed.
